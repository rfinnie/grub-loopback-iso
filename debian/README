== About ==

grub-loopback-iso is a GRUB 2 configuration hook to boot compatible
ISOs stored on the host filesystem. The stanzas built utilize GRUB
2's loopback mount support to chain a /boot/grub/loopback.cfg file on
an ISO.

== Installation ==

Place compatible ISOs in a suitable location.  By default, this is
/boot/isos, but may be changed by editing /etc/default/grub-loopback-iso
(for example, if the /boot partition is too small).  However, keep in
mind that the ISO's operating system may have restrictions on what type
of partition the ISO may be placed on; it is the ISO's operating system
(initrd most likely) which is responsible for finding the ISO by
scanning partitions, so the partition and filesystem must be known to
the ISO operating system.

Then simply run "update-grub", and verify the correct stanzas have been
created in /boot/grub/grub.cfg .
